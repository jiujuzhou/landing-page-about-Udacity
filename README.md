## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

I use the html,css and javascript to do these functions:
1. make 4 sections in html. 
2. I use Dom to create a empty nav bar.
3. I link the sections with the li items in the unordered list. 
4. I make an active class functionality when hover or click is performed. 
5. I highlight the sections which are being selected.
